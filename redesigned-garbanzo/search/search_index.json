It provides a rich set of classes and interfaces for representing languages, dialects, scripts, language families, and regions. The library also includes methods for obtaining language tags, checking language usage patterns, and territorializing languages. Xenoglot is essential for any project that requires accurate and consistent handling of language data.</p> <p>Key Features</p> <ul> <li> <p>Comprehensive Language Representation: Xenoglot provides a structured representation of   languages, dialects, scripts, language families, and regions, enabling accurate and consistent   handling of language data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Language Tag Generation: Xenoglot provides methods for generating language tags, facilitating   interoperability with language-related protocols and standards.</p> </li> <li> <p>Language Usage Analysis: Xenoglot includes methods for checking language usage patterns,   enabling informed decisions about language selection and content localization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Language Territorialization: Xenoglot provides functionality for territorializing languages,   adapting them to specific geographical or political contexts.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Installation</p> <p>To install Xenoglot, add the following dependency to your build script:</p> build.gradle.kts<pre><code>dependencies {\n  implementation(platform(\"dev.teogor.xenoglot:bom:1.0.0-alpha01\"))\n  implementation(\"dev.teogor.xenoglot:android\")\n  implementation(\"dev.teogor.xenoglot:core\")\n\n  // or without bom\n  implementation(\"dev.teogor.xenoglot:core:1.0.0-alpha01\")\n}\n</code></pre> build.gradle<pre><code>dependencies {\n  implementation(platform(\"dev.teogor.xenoglot:bom:1.0.0-alpha01\"))\n  implementation(\"dev.teogor.xenoglot:android\")\n  implementation(\"dev.teogor.xenoglot:core\")\n\n  // or without bom\n  implementation(\"dev.teogor.xenoglot:core:1.0.0-alpha01\")\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Usage</p> <p>The following examples demonstrate how to use Xenoglot to represent and interact with language data:</p> <p>Retrieving Language Information</p> <pre><code>val language = Language.English\nval languageTag = language.languageTag\nval languageFamily = language.languageFamily\nval isSpokenInRomania = language.isSpokenIn(Country.Romania)\n</code></pre> <p>Checking Language Usage Patterns</p> <pre><code>val isDialect = Dialect(\"en-US\", Language.English).isDialect\nval isScriptUsedInLanguage = Script.Cyrillic.isWrittenIn(Language.Russian)\n</code></pre> <p>Interacting with Language Tags</p> <pre><code>val languageTag = LanguageTag(\"fr\", LanguageFamily.Romance)\nval language = languageTag.asLanguage()\nval countryCode = languageTag.substringAfter(\"-\")\n</code></pre> <p>Territorializing Languages</p> <pre><code>val dialect = Language.English.territorialize(Country.Australia)\nval dialectLanguageTag = dialect.languageTag\nval dialectCountryCode = dialect.country.code\n</code></pre> <p>Benefits of Using Xenoglot</p> <ul> <li> <p>Improved Language Handling: Xenoglot provides a consistent and structured approach to managing   language data, reducing errors and inconsistencies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhanced Interoperability: Xenoglot facilitates interoperability with language-related   protocols and standards, enabling seamless integration with external systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simplified Language-Related Tasks: Xenoglot streamlines language-related tasks, such as   localization, translation, and language detection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Promote Language-Aware Development: Xenoglot encourages language-aware development practices,   ensuring that language data is handled accurately and appropriately.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Getting Started</p> <p>To get started with Xenoglot, refer to the comprehensive documentation available at source.teogor.dev/xenoglot. The documentation provides detailed explanations, examples, and best practices for using the library effectively.</p>"},{"location":"#find-this-repository-useful","title":"Find this repository useful? \ud83e\ude77","text":"<ul> <li>Support it by joining stargazers for this   repository. \ud83d\udcc1</li> <li>Get notified about my new projects by following me on GitHub. \ud83d\udcbb</li> <li>Interested in sponsoring me?
